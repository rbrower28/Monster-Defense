# Monster Defense 2D Shooting Game

Monster Defense is a 2D Top-Down shooter where you defend yourself against different monsters and see how long you can last! Try and beat the high score by shooting while keeping yourself free of the evil monsters.

Play in one of 3 gamemodes - easy, hard, and expert (which is almost impossible)

The controls are simple:

* Use WASD to move around
* Use the mouse to aim your gun
* Click the mouse to shoot
* and press Q to switch gamemodes. Simple as that!

I made this game to increase my proficiency in C# while having fun at the same time.

It was a great learning experience, and there is still much I could do to polish this game.

I encourage you to look at the repository, there is a lot there!
